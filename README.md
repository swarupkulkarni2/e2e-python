Python practice problems with solution...

1. Guessing Game.
     Create a simple number guessing game where the program generates a random number (between 1 and 20) and the user has to guess it. Provide hints like "Too high" or "Too           low" after each guess until the correct number is guessed.
2. Pallindrome Number Check.
     Create a program that checks if a given number is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward) using a while loop.
