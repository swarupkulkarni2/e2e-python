     Create a simple number guessing game where the program generates a random number (between 1 and 20) and the user has to guess it. Provide hints like "Too high" or "Too           low" after each guess until the correct number is guessed.

2. Pallindrome Number Check. (pallindromeCheck.py)
     Create a program that checks if a given number is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward) using a while loop.

3. Prime Number check. (primeNum-check.py)
     Write a program that takes an input from the user and determines whether it is a prime number or not, using a while loop.

4. Number Pattern. (number-pattern.py)
     Print the following pattern using a while loop:
   1
   1 2
